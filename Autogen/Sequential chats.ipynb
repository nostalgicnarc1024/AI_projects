      "Did you know that the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was coined by John McCarthy in 1955? He organized the famous Dartmouth Conference in 1956, which is considered the birth of AI as a field! Think about it—years before the internet, people were already envisioning machines capable of learning!\n",

      "### Interesting Story:\n",
      "Once, a team of researchers used computer vision to train a model to detect signs of depression through facial expressions and body language. They fed thousands of images into their system and, surprisingly, the model achieved higher accuracy than many human therapists! This bridged an interesting gap in technology and mental health, showing how AI could play a supporting role in emotional wellbeing. Imagine a world where your virtual assistant could help cheer you up just by observing your expressions!\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Why did the computer keep its secrets?**  \n",

      "5. **How do you organize a party in space?**  \n",
      "   You **planet**, but don't forget the **data** to keep it out of orbit!\n",

      "6. **Why was the computer cold?**  \n",
